{"name":"HVClientLibPHP","tagline":"An easy to use PHP library to connect to Microsoft® HealthVault™.","body":"HVClientLibPHP\r\n==============\r\n\r\nAn easy to use PHP library to connect to\r\n[Microsoft® HealthVault™](https://www.healthvault.com/)\r\non top of\r\n[HVRawConnectorPHP](https://github.com/mkalkbrenner/HVRawConnectorPHP/).\r\nIt adds a nicer object oriented programming interface and hides (most) of the\r\ncomplicated XML parts in the HealthVault protocol.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nHVClientLibPHP depends on\r\n[HVRawConnectorPHP](https://github.com/mkalkbrenner/HVRawConnectorPHP/).\r\nIf you simply use the latest development version of HVClientLibPHP from github\r\nyou have to ensure that HVRawConnectorPHP and all it's dependencies are\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\nThe latest stable version of HVClientLibPHP could be easily installed by pear.\r\nIn that case all it's dependencies will be installed automatically:\r\n\r\n    pear channel-discover pear.biologis.com\r\n    pear channel-discover pear.querypath.org\r\n    pear install biologis/HVClient\r\n\r\nThis method will install HVClientLibPHP as a library, but without the\r\navailable demo application.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n------\r\n\r\nHVClientLibPHP is not a full featured HealthVault SDK, but should provide all\r\nthe required stuff to create powerful HealthVault applications with PHP.\r\n\r\nIt can basically handle all\r\n[Things](http://developer.healthvault.com/pages/types/types.aspx) already,\r\nbut over the time we will add some more convenience function to the representing\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nBut the number of implemented\r\n[Methods](http://developer.healthvault.com/pages/methods/methods.aspx) is very\r\nlimited at the moment (the essential ones are available):\r\n* GetPersonInfo\r\n* GetThings\r\n* PutThings\r\n\r\nIf you need more and understand the available\r\n[Documentation](http://developer.healthvault.com/default.aspx), you can always\r\nuse HVRawConnectorPHP directly. In that case you should ideally contribute your\r\nwork to let HVClientLibPHP grow faster.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSome examples will follow later.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile you can have a look at the demo_app source code.\r\n\r\n\r\nDemo\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe demo_app included in this repository currently demonstrates two features:\r\n* It queries a user's HealthVault record for all\r\n\"[Things](http://developer.healthvault.com/pages/types/types.aspx)\" and dumps the\r\nraw XML content.\r\n* It lists all files uploaded to your selected health record and lets you upload\r\nadditional files.\r\n\r\nBy default it uses the US pre production instance of HealthVault.\r\n\r\nTo get started, follow the install instructions above and put the demo_app folder\r\non a web server and access \"demo_app/index.php\".\r\n\r\n\r\nLicence\r\n-------\r\n\r\n[GPLv2](https://raw.github.com/mkalkbrenner/HVClientLibPHP/master/LICENSE.txt).\r\n\r\n\r\nSponsor\r\n-------\r\n[bio.logis](https://www.biologis.com) offers users of\r\n[pgsbox.de](https://pgsbox.de) a way to upload their diagnostic reports to\r\nHealthVault.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
